### Monty : C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO

### BARTA ZOUHAIR and Hicham EL MAATAOUI

### This repository contains the Monty project, which is a simple interpreter for Monty bytecode files. The project is implemented in C.

### Project Overview

*** The Monty project implements a stack-based interprreter for Monty bytecode files. The interpreter supports various operations sush as pushing elements onto the stack, printing stack values, performing arihmetic operations, manipulating the stack, and more ..

*** Monty is a simple interpreter for Monty Bytecode files. Monty Bytcode files have the .m extension and contain a series of opcodes that can be executed by the Monty inerpreter.

***Objectives:

To know what LIFO and FIFO mean
To know what a stack is, and when to use it
To know what a queue is, and when to use it
To know the common implementations of stacks and queues
To know the most common use cases of stacks and queues
To know the proper way to use global variables

***General Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files is compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All files ends with a new line
There is README.md file at the root of the alx-low_level_programming
Maximum of one global variable is allowed
No more than 5 functions per file
The C standard library is allowed
The prototypes of all the functions were included in the header file called monty.h
All the header files are include guarded
